# Ceasar_cipher_compare
On stdin we have 2 strings of text, one is coded by Ceasar cipher (correctly), another is not coded, but contains wrong letters ("someone has heard it wrong"). 
Program tries all possible shifts in cipher, figures out the most suitable one and then decodes coded string. As a result we have original message without errors.
